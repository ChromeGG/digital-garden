## 🐧Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa

I am using default GNOME. I used Unity in ubuntu 18, but for me there were not souch a big difference. Furthermore, I used the Manjaro and Deepin either, but Ubuntu has better support and I don't waste time for configuration not working, simple things. It's connected with me phone with KDE Plasma.  I also added a fiew usefull plugins like better clipboard, improve handling of I/O devices, better workspaces. 

♻️ Thanks to TimeShif, I have automatic bacups every time when my system is booting. Additionally, I made a full image of my disk with RescueZilla.

## Visual Studio Code

In the past, I was a fanboy of JetBrains's products. Today I cannot imagine work in someting different from VSC. The setup is inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQMeBtnldXU). Protip: if you hide every bar and most of the icons, you have to learn the kaybord shortcuts ⌨️ 🧠.
