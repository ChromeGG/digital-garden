# Rework

**Lessons:**
- Flexing with company size is bulshit. Small company can generate bigger income, better knowledge transofrm, better work terms than corporations,
- Plans for distant future (+9 months) are sensless. The world is chainging too fast for complex business plans wrote on the paper for the next couple of years,
- Flexing with number of meetings are stupid. Very often the meetings are not required to propagete information in the compony, async is better,
- Customer support is critical. *You are very important for us. You are 20 in the queue.* If I'm so important, why I have to wait so long?
