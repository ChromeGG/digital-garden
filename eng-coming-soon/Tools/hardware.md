## 🖥️ Dell U2722DE + Dell U2722D

I bought the frame only. The top is from local salter couse it was chiper and the quality is 💯

## 🎧 SteelSeries Arctis 9 Wireless

I chose them because they were supposed to be useful for connecting to a computer and PS5 at the same time, but in the end I never connected them to the PS5.

## 🖱️ Logitech MX Master 3

Wireless mice.

## ⌨️ Logitech G613

Wireless keyboard.

## 🔊 Logitech Z200

Just normal speakers, enought for me 🤷‍♂️

Used with cheap arm. But if I had to choose again, I would choose something without the arm, with the stand, like Yeti Blackout.
